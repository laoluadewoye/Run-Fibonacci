a|Version 2.1.0 (In Development)
a|* Added new environmental variables `SECRET_PEM_TARGET`, `DATASTORE_USER`, `DATASTORE_PASSWORD` to support datastore authentication and tls setup.
* Added `pymongo` and `psycopg2` Python libraries to `requirements.txt`.
* Changed constant `SERVER_CONFIG` to `SERVER_IDENTIFIER` and simplified `SERVER_IDENTIFIER` to take up less space when saved to datastores in `rest.py`.
* Restructured log schema to create fields `time`, `server`, `type`, `kinds`, `details`, and `hash` as the information to work with for datastores in `datastore_utils.py`.
* Added logic for creating PostgreSQL and MongoDB connections in `datastore_utils.py`.
* Completed logic for contacting available datastores in `datastore_utils.py`.
* Updated `TestVersion.py` and `TestGenTLS.py` to reflect updates to version.

a|Version 2.0.0 (Available tags are `latest`, `2.0.0`, `2.0.0-alpine`, `2.0.0-alma`)
a|* Added new `datastore_utils.py` for handling log definitions, log output, and log saving. Updated `rest.py` to reflect changes.
* Added new environmental variables `SERVER_DATASTORE`, `DATASTORE_ADDRESS`, `DATASTORE_PORT`, `DATASTORE_FILEPATH`, `DATASTORE_DEFAULT_FILEPATH`, and `DATASTORE_OPERATIONS_FILEPATH` to support multiple kinds of datastores.
* Updated Dockerfiles to copy entire `components` folder rather than individual files, and to install Python libraries using a requirements file.
* Added new log saving API to `rest.py`.
* Converted shell scripts for healthcheck and start API to Python programs. Adjusted `rest.py` accordingly.
* Servers now run python from a virtual environment instead of a system environment.
* *Warning: Only rest API and none/file datastores are available*

a|Version 1.2.0 (Available tags are `1.2.0`, `1.2.0-alpine`, `1.2.0-alma`)
a|* Added new environmental variable `SERVER_API` To support multiple kinds of APIs.
* Revised Dockerfile to use a base Alpine layer with Python manually installed rather than a Python base layer that is Alpine specific.
* Added Alma linux version of server.
* *Risk: Python version is now 3.12 instead of 3.13 for consistency across platforms. Is looking into ways to get Alma back up a version up without too much added image size.*
* Tests are now run using Python instead of Powershell/Bash to automate testing different platforms, apis, and storage combinations in the future.

a|Version 1.1.0 (Available tags are `1.1.0`, `1.1.0-alpine`)
a|* Split `SELF_ADDRESS` into `SELF_LISTENING_ADDRESS` and `SELF_HEALTHCHECK_ADDRESS` for better Pod capabilities.
* Updated test scripts to reflect changes. Changed container testing scripts to first check what container engine is running.

a|Version 1.0.1 (Available tags are `1.0.1`, `1.0.1-alpine`)
a|* Changed `SERVER_STAGE_INDEX` check to allow equality to `SERVER_STAGE_COUNT`
* Added test scripts for both Windows and Linux systems

a|Version 1.0.0 (Available tags are `1.0.0`, `1.0.0-alpine`)
