|Version 1.2.0
a|* Added new environmental variable `SERVER_API` To support multiple kinds of APIs.
* Revised Dockerfile to use a base Alpine layer with Python manually installed rather than a Python base layer that is Alpine specific.
* Added Alma linux version of server.
* Risk: Python version is now 3.12 instead of 3.13 for consistency across platforms. Is looking into ways to get Alma back up a version up without too much added image size.
* Tests are now run using Python instead of Powershell/Bash to automate testing different platforms, apis, and storage combinations in the future.

|Version 1.1.0
a|* Split `SELF_ADDRESS` into `SELF_LISTENING_ADDRESS` and `SELF_HEALTHCHECK_ADDRESS` for better Pod capabilities.
